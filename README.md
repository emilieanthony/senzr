# Senzr App


## Product description
Senzr is an app created for people who want to optimize their health and well-being by influencing air quality in indoor environments. 

Closed, poorly ventilated spaces often have carbon dioxide levels greater than 1000 parts per million. Headaches, impaired mental function, and lethargy have all been linked to high carbon dioxide concentrations that many people are exposed to in their daily lives for hours at a time.

Elevated carbon dioxide concentrations are an indication that there isn’t enough fresh air in many buildings and homes. For instance, unventilated bedrooms often have high concentrations of carbon dioxide, especially when there is more than one occupant using the room. Typically, carbon dioxide levels rise during the night when people are sleeping, especially if the door and windows are closed. The concentrations then fall during the day if the room is unoccupied. Unfortunately, poor air quality can hinder restful sleep and optimum health in many homes.

Through a carbon dioxide sensor, Senzr App will notify the user when high levels of carbon dioxide occur. Senzr App also allows the user to track carbon dioxdide levels over time. With this information, the user can take action to improve the indoor air quality.
